## What is Hazel for Mac?

Hazel is a powerful automation utility for macOS designed to help users manage files and folders effortlessly. By creating custom rules, you can automate repetitive tasks such as organizing downloads, sorting documents, renaming files, and even trashing outdated items.  

The tool monitors specified folders and executes actions based on conditions you set—whether it’s the file type, name, date, or content. This makes it an essential app for anyone looking to maintain an organized and efficient digital environment without manual intervention.  

Hazel integrates deeply with macOS, supporting native features like Tags, Quick Look, and Spotlight. It is compatible with all modern Macs, including those with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3), and runs smoothly on macOS Ventura and Sonoma.  

Whether you're a student, professional, or creative, Hazel saves time and reduces digital clutter, allowing you to focus on what matters most.
